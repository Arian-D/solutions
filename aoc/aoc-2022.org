#+description: My inconsistent advent of code solutions in various languages.

* Day 1
** Emacs Lisp
- There's no built-in =sum= in lisp-land, so we can =apply= the =+= function.
- Here, I'm using =apply-partially= to somewhat simulate currying.
- Although =cl-reduce= requires the =cl= library, it's advantageous over
  =seq-reduce= because it does not require an initial item, thus making
  it suitable for =apply-partially=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun sorted-calories (input-file)
    "Read the file and return a sorted list of elf item calories."
    (with-temp-buffer
      (insert-file-contents input-file)
      (let* ((file-content (buffer-string))
             (list (split-string file-content "\n\n"))
             (list-of-lists (mapcar
                             (lambda (list) (split-string list "\n"))
                             list))
             (parsed (mapcar (apply-partially #'mapcar
                                              #'string-to-number)
                             list-of-lists)) 
             (summed-up (mapcar (apply-partially #'cl-reduce #'+) parsed)))
        (sort summed-up #'>))))

  (let* ((sorted (sorted-calories "/tmp/input.txt"))
         (part-1-solution (car sorted))
         (part-2-solution
          (apply #'+ (seq-take sorted 3))))
    (print (list part-1-solution part-2-solution)))
#+end_src

** Haskell
- The function is [[https://wiki.haskell.org/Pointfree][point-free]] and simple compositions.
- This solution is inefficient because =sort= sorts items in ascending
  order and I =reverse= them. It gets the job done for this simple
  problem, but if I needed to make it more efficient I would've used
  the =sortBy= function instead and used a different =compare= to avoid reversing.
- I'll only mention it here because it's the first problem, but haskell offers lots of functions that
  offer richer types like =Maybe= and =Either= to do this in a more
  error-free manner in cases like parsing integers or reading files,
  but instead I just went with the ezâ„¢ solution.
#+begin_src haskell :results output
import Data.List (sort)
import Data.List.Split (splitOn)

sortedCalories :: String -> [Int]
sortedCalories =
    (reverse . sort . (map sum) . (map (map read)) . (splitOn [""]) . lines)

highest = head . sortedCalories

top3highest = sum . (take 3) . sortedCalories

main = do
  file <- readFile "/tmp/input.txt"
  -- Part 1 solution
  print . highest $ file
  -- Part 2 solution
  print . top3highest $ file
#+end_src

#  It doesn't look good (yet), but I'll either use minted for syntax
#  highlighting, or I'll be lazy and use ox-hugo. We'll see

** Python
- Once again, we're abusing all the functional programming features
  like =.split=, =map=, and [[https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions][list comprehensions]].
- =sorted= has a positional argument called =reverse= that lets us sort in
  descending order. This allows us to use the top of the list.
- Just like the previous solutions, it is not done in one-pass, making
  it an inefficient but easy solution.
#+begin_src python
  with open("/tmp/input.txt", 'r') as f:
      sorted_calories = sorted((
          sum(map(int, elf.split('\n')))
          for elf in f.read().split("\n\n")
          if '' not in elf.split('\n')
      ), reverse=True)

      print(f"Part 1: {sorted_calories[0]}")
      print(f"Part 2: {sum(sorted_calories[:3])}")
#+end_src

* Day 2
** Python
- Imperative verbose solution
- I figured out I could use modular arithmetic in the 2nd part, but I
  kept the first part's method (checking against a set of winning
  tuples) because it's more readable to me
#+begin_src python
  with open("inputs/day2.txt", 'r') as f:
      total = 0
      real_total = 0
      for players in f.read().split('\n'):
          if players == "":
              continue
          # Part 1
          opponent, me = players.split()
          values = opponent, me
          if values in {('C', 'X'), ('A', 'Y'), ('B', 'Z')}:
              total += 6
          if ord(opponent) - ord('A') == ord(me) - ord('X'):
              total += 3
          total += ord(me) - (ord('X') - 1)

          # Part 2
          choice = me
          if choice == 'Y': # Draw
              real_total += ord(opponent) - (ord('A') - 1)
              real_total += 3
          elif choice == 'X': # Lose
              real_total += (((ord(opponent) - ord('A')) - 1) % 3) + 1
              real_total += 0
          elif choice == 'Z': # Win
              real_total += (((ord(opponent) - ord('A')) + 1) % 3) + 1
              real_total += 6
      print(f"Part 1: {total}")
      print(f"Part 2: {real_total}")


#+end_src
** C
- C is perfect for this problem since there's no extra =ord= being used
  everywhere; C chars could be used in ordinary arithmetic
***  Part 1
- =fscanf= allows reading two spaced integers, so I took advantage of
  that for reading both characters.
- As per previous solution, I ommited the loss case, becasue it'd be unnecessary
- If you wanna see the assembly, check [[https://godbolt.org/z/KPz3W9WrP][Godbolt's website]]

#+begin_src C
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main() {
    FILE * input = fopen("inputs/day2.txt", "r");
    char opponent, me;
    unsigned int total = 0;
    do {
      int ret = fscanf(input, "%c %c\n", &opponent, &me);
      if (opponent - 'A' == me - 'X') // Draw
        total += 3;
      else if ((opponent - 'A' + 1) % 3 == me - 'X') // Win
        total += 6;
      total += me - 'X' + 1;
    } while (!feof(input));
    printf("Part 1: %d\n", total);
    fclose(input);
  }
#+end_src
*** Part 2
- Another nice thing with C is that there's switch-case, unlike Python
  (at least not until [[https://peps.python.org/pep-0636/][recently]])
- The behavior  of =%= is unlike Python, where negative numbers are in
  the domain. This requires the use of a simple ternary operator to
  handle negative cases. (See this [[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/801962/difference-between-modulus-and-remainder#801988][stackexchange answer]])
- [[https://godbolt.org/z/8hf8hbc7e][x86-64 assembly]] for the insane
#+begin_src C
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main() {
    FILE * input = fopen("inputs/day2.txt", "r");
    char opponent, choice;
    unsigned int total = 0;
    do {
      int ret = fscanf(input, "%c %c\n", &opponent, &choice);
      int me;
      switch (choice) {
      case 'X':
        me = (opponent - 'A' - 1);
        me = me < 0 ? 3 : me + 1;
        break;
      case 'Y':
        me = opponent - 'A' + 1;
        total += 3;
        break;
      case 'Z':
        me = ((opponent - 'A' + 1) % 3) + 1;
        total += 6;
        break;
      }
      total += me;
    } while (!feof(input));
    printf("Part 2: %d\n", total);
    fclose(input);
  }
#+end_src
* Day 3
Another day of awful inefficient solutions ðŸ™‚
** Haskell
*** Part 1
- Here we /can/ use =fromEnum= for getting the ASCII value, but =ord= is
  just simpler
- One thing to note is that Haskell Strings are just =[Char]=, meaning
  they're lazy lists with lots of memory overhead (see [[https://wiki.haskell.org/Strings][this]]). This
  leads =length= going through the whole list in addition to =splitAt=
- =intersect= finds the intersect of two lists, but since our data is
  already in tuples, =uncurry= just makes the types fit.
#+begin_src haskell
import Data.List (intersect)
import Data.Char (ord, isLower)

findPriority :: [String] -> [Int]
findPriority = map $
  -- Get the priority
  (\item -> ord item - (if isLower item then (ord 'a') - 1 else (ord 'A') - 27))
  -- Find the common character
  . head . uncurry intersect
  -- Split lines into tuples
  . \line -> splitAt (length line `div` 2) line

main :: IO ()
main = readFile "inputs/day3.txt" >>= (print . sum . findPriority . lines)
#+end_src
*** Part 2
- Would you look at that! More imports ðŸ™‚
- Once again, we're =intersect=-ing, but this time it's every 3
  lines. The Sequence library has got the handy =chunksOf= which will
  take care of that, but that introduces the (in)convenience of
  having to deal with sequences; they have more efficient functions,
  but you now have to deal with type conversion.
- =><= is the equivalent of =++=, and folding that gives us the
  badge.
 #+begin_src haskell
import Data.List (intersect)
import Data.Char (ord, isLower)
import Data.Sequence (chunksOf, fromList, (><))
import Data.Foldable (toList)

badgeCount :: [String] -> Int
badgeCount = sum
  . fmap (\badge ->
          ord badge - if isLower badge then (ord 'a') - 1 else (ord 'A') - 27)
  . fmap (head . foldl1 (intersect . toList))
  . chunksOf 3 . fromList

main :: IO ()
main = readFile "inputs/day3.txt" >>= (print . badgeCount .  lines)
  #+end_src
* Day 4
** TS/JS
*** Part 1
#+begin_src typescript :tangle ./aoc.js
  const fs = require('fs')

  function contains(pair1, pair2) {
      return (pair1[0] >= pair2[0] && pair1[1] <= pair2[1])
          || (pair2[0] >= pair1[0] && pair2[1] <= pair1[1])
  }

  fs.readFile("./inputs/day4.txt", "utf8", (_, data) => {
      const count =
          data.split('\n')
              .map((line) => line.split(',').map((range) => range.split('-').map((num) => parseInt(num))))
              .filter((range) => range.length == 2 && contains(range[0], range[1]))
              .length
      console.log(`Part 1: ${count}`)
  })
